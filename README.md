# Python Guidelines

This repository hopes to be a reference for everyone that's being introduced to Python and also, provide a set of curated practical and interesting resources for more experience developers. A place where you can learn something new whenever you like, or come back to refresh something you already knew.

I'll start with a introduction to Python from scratch, and after that, you can find organized resources. PRs are welcome.
